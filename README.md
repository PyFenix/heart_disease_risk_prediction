## Project Overview

This project:

- Fetches the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Processes and prepares the data for analysis.
- Provides a foundation for building predictive models to assess heart disease risk.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- **Python Version**: Python 3.12 or higher.
- **Git**: Installed on your system.
- **`pip`**: Python package installer is available.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart_disease_risk_prediction.git
cd heart_disease_risk_prediction
  ```

### 2. Install `uv`

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a Python project management tool that simplifies environment and dependency management.

#### a. Upgrade `pip`

- Upgrade `pip` to the latest version using

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### b. Install `uv`

- Install `uv` globally using `pip install uv`.

```bash
pip install uv
```

#### c. Verify Installation

- Check that `uv` is installed by running `uv --version`. You should see the version number printed.

```bash
uv --version
```

  You should see the version number printed.

---

### 3. Initialize the Project and Virtual Environment

Use `uv` to initialize the project, which will create a virtual environment and set up project configurations based on `pyproject.toml`:

- Run `uv init` to initialize the project.

```bash
uv init
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`:

- Use `uv install` to install dependencies.

```bash
uv install
```

## Usage

### Activate the Virtual Environment

Before running any scripts, activate the virtual environment:

- Activate the virtual environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate`.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see the virtual environment's name in your terminal prompt.

### Run `make_dataset.py`

Fetch and prepare the dataset by running the `make_dataset.py` script:

- Run `python src/data/make_dataset.py [output_file_path]`, where `[output_file_path]` is the desired location for the saved dataset, such as `data/raw/heart_disease_original_data.csv`.

```bash
python src/data/make_dataset.py data/raw/heart_disease_original_data.csv
```

This command will:

- Fetch the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI repository.
- Save the dataset to the specified path (e.g., `data/raw/heart_disease_original_data.csv`).
- Create the directory for the dataset if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

Note: this part is optional, further down the path, I wrote another function that checks for the data to load it into a dataframe, else dowload it from the source
